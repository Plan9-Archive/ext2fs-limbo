# status

seems to works, not optimized (no caching).  needs a bit of testing,
especially on large partitions with many files & directories.


# about

ext2fs is an implementation of the ext2 (second extended) file
system, written in limbo, for inferno.  it gives read-only access
to the contents of ext2 file systems.

see the manual page ext2fs(4) for details.


# download

get the latest version from:

	http://www.ueber.net/code/r/ext2fs


# install

make sure you have $ROOT set.  now run "mk" to compile and "mk
install" to install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- perhaps cache directory blocks while reading directories?
- perhaps more caching?  eg inode blocks/parsed inodes, indirect blocks.
- perhaps do latin1 conversion?
- directory content hashing/btree, for faster walk?

- ext2dump: make more useful?  eg letting you specify inode to print, directory inode to list.
- ext2dump: allow specifying block/offset to dump superblock from?  and finding the group descriptors?
- support for the bitmaps?  and some verifications against them?

- handle possible ext3 fields/flags?
- implement writing
